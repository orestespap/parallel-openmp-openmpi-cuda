# Open MP, Open MPI and Cuda parallelization in C
C code using Open MP, OpenMPI and CUDA parallelizing frequently encountered CS algorithms such as character frequency, count sort, gauss elimination and a few more.

This code is part of the homework that I did for my undergrad High Performance Computation course at the University of Macedonia.
